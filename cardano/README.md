# Cardano Smart Contracts

This directory contains the smart contracts for the BASIX-IP-Marketplace dApp. The smart contracts are written in [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/), a modern and developer-friendly smart contract language for Cardano.

## Project Structure

The smart contracts are organized into two main components:

- **Marketplace**: Manages the creation, transfer, and sale of NFTs.
- **Education**: Manages the issuance of verifiable credentials as NFTs.

Each component has its own Aiken project with its own set of validators.

## Getting Started

To build and test the smart contracts, you will need to install the [Aiken CLI](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-guide). Once installed, you can run the following commands in each project directory:

- `aiken build`: Build the smart contracts.
- `aiken test`: Run the tests for the smart contracts.
